# December 9th 2024 - Weekly Problem Set

## How To Engage With These Problems
When taking on these problems, you should try to solve them on your own for 15-20 minutes, **but no longer**.
Not knowing the answer is fine. You want to ensure you give yourself time to work your brain to solve it, but not waste time if you just don't have the knowledge.

After 15-20 minutes, you can then view other peoples solutions in the "Solutions" tab in the LeetCode window.
When you view the solution, you should then take the time (at least 25 minutes at a time) to understand how the solution works, adding it to your own code window and changing pieces of it to help understand what each part does. 
Then, take a 5 minute break. After that break, come back and try to solve the problem on your own again with no help.

## Data Analysis and Data Engineering

This week, we will continue refreshing and building our SQL skills.

**Including explanation from last weeks problem set**
In Data Analysis, there is a lot of power in being able to know where something is and pulling it yourself.
If you have to ask someone to write the SQL for you, or do any data pulling for you, you now have a built-in delay for any problem you are asked to analyze or solve. Also, if someone else writes the query, they might not be applying the right criteria and conditionals to the data you want. If you base your analysis off this data, your analysis might be wrong from the start.

Knowledge is power, and the more fluent you are with SQL and database design the more power you'll have.
